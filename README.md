# N-Queens Problem Solver


> Overview:

The N-Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge in which the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using recursion and backtracking.

> Features:

1. Solves the N-Queens problem for any number of queens (N >= 4). 
2. Efficient backtracking algorithm to find a solution.
3. Checks for safe positions before placing queens.
4. Outputs a valid board configuration if a solution exists.

> Prerequisites:

1. A C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Basic understanding of C++ and algorithms.

> Input:

The program will prompt you to enter the number of queens. Enter an integer value greater than or equal to 4.

> Output:

If a solution exists, the program will output a valid configuration of the board with the queens placed such that no two queens can attack each other. The board will be printed as a matrix where '1' represents a queen and '0' represents an empty space.

> Example:

Here is an example of how the program works:


Enter the number of queens (minimum 4): 4

The possible solution for 4 queens is:

0 1 0 0

0 0 0 1

1 0 0 0

0 0 1 0


> Code Structure:

"NQueensProblem.cpp" contains the implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using recursion and a backtracking algorithm.

> Acknowledgements:

This project was implemented as part of a learning exercise to understand and solve the N-Queens problem using recursion and backtracking. 
Thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and inspiration.
